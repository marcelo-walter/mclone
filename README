MCLONE - The Clonal Mosaic Project

This is the software implementation of the following thesis, from Marcelo
Walter:

M. Walter. Integration of Complex Shapes and Natural Patterns. Ph.D. thesis,
University of British Columbia, December 1998.

During its lifetime, it has been modified by Ricardo Binsfeld, Fabiane Queiroz,
Thompson Peter, and other collaborators. Feel free to report bugs and send bug
fixes. They are going to be treated with pretty much affection :-)

For quick information about how the algorithm works, take a look at the MClone
article on wikipedia (it is very simple, for now), at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MClone



Building
========

First things first, what you really need to know is that if you really want to
build this project, you should take a look at the needed libraries in
"WhatLibs.txt", in the documentation folder.

The project hasn't yet any Makefile, since we use Eclipse to compile it. A
Makefile will be made soon so you can compile it decently. Otherwise, if you
want to build the program using Eclipse, take a look at "MakingWithEclipse.txt",
at the documentation folder (/doc/MakingWithEclipse.txt).



Hacking
=======

If you're planning to hack into the code, I suggest you take a look at
"Hacking.txt", in the documentation folder. There, I provide you with some
useful information that could save you some time.

Any changes are welcome :-)
