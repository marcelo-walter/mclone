Introduction
============

There are some libraries which you need to have in order to get MClone builded.
Provide you with these libraries already compiled in a folder of the project
would be very weighty (just an example, ImageMagick has 12Mb of code and, after
compiled, occuppies over 110Mb of you hard disk space). So, as an alternative,
we provide you some instructions about how to have these libraries working.

If you know any way of getting them working without doing what we say here, you
can, of course, do it your way. If you think your way is better than what we say
here, please let us know your way sending an e-mail to the author of this file.

The libs needed to the program are listed here on the beggining of the file, so
you don't have to continue reading if you don't want to:

 - ImageMagick
 - Voronoi3D (which comes in the /lib/ folder of the project)


ImageMagick
===========

The first library you should download to get your MClone builded is called
ImageMagick. Go to www.imagemagick.org and download the ImageMagick version to
your operating system. I can't help too much if you're on Mac or Windows, but
I describe here the steps I needed to go through to get ImageMagick running
in my computer.

The important thing is: you have to know where your ImageMagick library was
installed in your computer, so you can use this information during the building
process.

	For Linux users (but other ones can read it too):
	=================================================

	Since ImageMagick has an usual source code, after the download from the
	web site, you could just run (after changing directory to the folder
	where it was uncompressed) something like:

	./configure
	make
	make install      #(or "sudo make install", if on a Debian like distro)

	But this should not make sure you've installed ImageMagick in a regular
	place. I.e., depending of your system, ImageMagick is likely to be
	installed in some different places.

	Since we want it to be installed in "/usr/local/", we are going to pass
	it as a parameter to the configure script:

	./configure --prefix="/usr/local"
	make
	make install

	Sometimes, if even after the instalation your ImageMagick still don't
	work, try running

	ldconfig

	on your command prompt so the new libraries can be loaded.
