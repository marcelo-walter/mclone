Introduction
============

This file is supposed to contain some information that could be useful to anyone
that is going to hack into the code of MClone. If you have suffered during hour
working around some problem and you think other people should know about it,
send me an e-mail or commit your modification to the project on GoogleCode and
it will probably be attached to this file.
Also, if you think any of the explanations below need some modifications (for
any reason, like "it is not clear enough" or "it has some gramatical errors"),
I'd be pleased to receive reports.

(the project is not maintained by native english speakers, so we'd really
appreciate corrections, if you find any error)




1. When do I have to recompile Voronoi3D?
=========================================

When Voronoi3D is "maked", it results in a file called "libvoronoi.a", which is
a library attached to MClone during linking phase. Although it is a separated
library, it resembles in MClone data structures so it can send/receive some
information from/to MClone. Thus, modifying MClone data structures is a task
that should receive special attention.

The file that works as a bridge from MClone and Voronoi3D is called
"interfaceVoronoi.h". Specifically, it uses a function which is defined below

extern "C" void getVoronoi( SCELL *headCell, SCELL *tailCell,
                                voronoiType **vorList, faceType **faceList,
                                int *howManyVert );

Thus, when modifying any of these data structures (SCELL, voronoiType or
faceType), be sure to recompile Voronoi3D using the new types, or the library
will work imprevisibly.
